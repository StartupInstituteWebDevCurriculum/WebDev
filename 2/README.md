# Front End Dev - 101
We will cover the following:
1. Developer Tools
1. HTML, CSS
1. Bootstrap
For homework students should make a static about me page using only html and css.
See the example-about-me for an example.

Students should also send their instructor their Github user names so that they can be added to the shared repo.

The instructor should make a single shared repo for students to build their about me pages in.
